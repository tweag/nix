# Release X.Y (202?-??-??)

* Commands which take installables on the command line can now read them from the standard input if
  passed the `--stdin` flag. This is primarily useful when you have a large amount of paths which
  exceed the OS arg limit.

* The `nix-hash` command now supports Base64 and SRI. Use the flags `--base64`
  or `--sri` to specify the format of output hash as Base64 or SRI, and `--to-base64`
  or `--to-sri` to convert a hash to Base64 or SRI format, respectively.

  As the choice of hash formats is no longer binary, the `--base16` flag is also added
  to explicitly specify the Base16 format, which is still the default.

* The special handling of an [installable](../command-ref/new-cli/nix.md#installables) with `.drv` suffix being interpreted as all of the given [store derivation](../glossary.md#gloss-store-derivation)'s output paths is removed, and instead taken as the literal store path that it represents.

  The new `^` syntax for store paths introduced in Nix 2.13 allows explicitly referencing output paths of a derivation.
  Using this is better and more clear than relying on the now-removed `.drv` special handling.

  For example,
  ```shell-session
  $ nix path-info /nix/store/gzaflydcr6sb3567hap9q6srzx8ggdgg-glibc-2.33-78.drv
  ```

  now gives info about the derivation itself, while

  ```shell-session
  $ nix path-info /nix/store/gzaflydcr6sb3567hap9q6srzx8ggdgg-glibc-2.33-78.drv^*
  ```
  provides information about each of its outputs.

  This requires the `discard-references` experimental feature.

* Documentation for operations of `nix-store` and `nix-env` are now available on separate pages of the manual.
  They include all common options that can be specified and common environment variables that affect these commands.

  These pages can be viewed offline with `man` using

  * `man nix-store-<operation>` and `man nix-env-<operation>`
  * `nix-store --help --<operation>` and `nix-env --help --<operation>`.
